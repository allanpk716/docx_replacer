# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Development Commands

### Building the Project
```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run

# Build for release
dotnet build -c Release

# Publish the application
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test
dotnet test --filter "TestName"
```

### Debugging
The project includes debug configurations in Visual Studio 2022 and supports hot reload during development.

## Architecture Overview

DocuFiller is a WPF desktop application built with .NET 8 that follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with dependency injection and layered architecture.

### Core Architecture Components

1. **MVVM Pattern**:
   - Views (XAML) bind to ViewModels via DataContext
   - ViewModels handle business logic and state management
   - Models represent data structures

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Services are registered in `App.xaml.cs:ConfigureServices()`
   - Uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
   - Services are resolved via constructor injection

3. **Service Layer Architecture**:
   - **Document Processing**: `IDocumentProcessor` handles Word document manipulation using OpenXML
   - **Data Parsing**: `IDataParser` processes JSON data files
   - **File Operations**: `IFileService` manages file I/O operations
   - **Progress Reporting**: `IProgressReporter` tracks and reports processing progress
   - **File Scanning**: `IFileScanner` discovers template files in directories
   - **Directory Management**: `IDirectoryManager` handles folder operations

4. **Configuration System**:
   - Uses `App.config` for application settings
   - Configuration values accessed via `ConfigurationManager.AppSettings`
   - Supports runtime configuration updates

### Key Models and Data Flow

1. **ProcessRequest**: Encapsulates all data needed for document processing
2. **ProcessResult**: Contains results and statistics from processing operations
3. **ProgressEventArgs**: Carries progress information during long-running operations
4. **ContentControlData**: Represents Word document content controls that can be filled with data

### Document Processing Pipeline

1. Template file selection (.docx/.dotx)
2. JSON data file parsing and validation
3. Content control extraction from template
4. Data mapping and validation
5. Batch document generation with progress tracking
6. Output file management and organization

## Important Implementation Details

### OpenXML Integration
The application uses DocumentFormat.OpenXml SDK to manipulate Word documents:
- Content controls are identified by their tags/aliases
- Data is mapped to controls based on matching field names
- Supports text content replacement in structured documents

### JSON Data Structure
Expected JSON format is an array of objects where each object represents one document:
```json
[
  {
    "FieldName": "Value",
    "AnotherField": "AnotherValue"
  }
]
```

### Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive exception handling with `GlobalExceptionHandler`
- Structured logging using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
- Log files stored in `Logs` directory with configurable retention
- User-friendly error messages displayed in UI

### Thread Safety
- Long-running operations use async/await patterns
- Progress reporting is thread-safe via events
- UI updates are marshaled to the UI thread
